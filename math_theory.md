 cos(θ) (cosine) = adjacent / hypotenuse
→ how far along x-axis

sin(θ) (sine) = opposite / hypotenuse
→ how far along y-axis




x = cos(angle); // horizontal direction
y = sin(angle); // vertical direction
This gives you a unit vector (length = 1) pointing in direction angle.

angle = 0         → (cos, sin) = (1, 0)    → facing right  
angle = π/2       → (0, 1)                 → facing up  
angle = π         → (-1, 0)                → facing left  
angle = 3π/2      → (0, -1)                → facing down
